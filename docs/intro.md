# AI Missional Tech Trends

## Executive Summary

AI is advancing at a breathtaking pace, moving beyond narrow, task-specific systems into more general and human-like capabilities. As Christian technologists and ministry leaders, we must approach these developments through a redemptive lens. The Apostle Paul’s vision frames salvation not merely as an escape to heaven but as an embrace of our future and true vocation in the New Heavens and the New Earth. It is also a call for believers to participate in God’s redemption and restoration in the here and now. In this view, technology is not value-neutral or merely utilitarian; instead of only asking _“Does it work efficiently?”_, we must ask: _“Does this technology align with God’s purposes for redemption and renewal?”_

FaithTech’s ultimate vision is redemptive technology that points back to Jesus – creating and using tech in ways that reflect His love, justice, and truth in the world. This means embracing our identity as His representatives and co-creators who approach innovation with humility and resists the Tower of Babel temptation of disobedience. In a world increasingly united by the “one language” of code, we point to the one true God and seek to build AI systems that honor His intent for community and healing rather than human pride. With this theological foundation, we explore the latest AI trends of early 2025 and their implications for ministry. Each advancement carries both opportunities to further the gospel and risks that require careful and prayerful navigation.
