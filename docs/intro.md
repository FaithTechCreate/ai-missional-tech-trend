# AI Missional Tech Trends

## Executive Summary

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is primarily a tool for specific, data-driven tasks, far from the human-like intelligence often depicted in popular culture. AI systems excel at pattern recognition and decision-making based on statistical analysis, focusing on narrow tasks. Today, AI is already embedded in much of everyday life, influencing everything from online searches to healthcare, voice assistants, and predictive analytics. 

Looking ahead, AI’s potential includes advancements toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), though its arrival is speculative. AI will continue to transform industries, automating tasks in the workforce and driving innovations in fields like healthcare. However, AI also raises ethical concerns around bias, privacy, and accountability, among others, as its data-driven decisions can perpetuate existing societal inequalities.

AI’s energy consumption and environmental impact are also important considerations. Christian developers should prioritize stewardship and transparency, ensuring that AI systems serve the greater good, supporting God’s purposes for humanity rather than distorting them.

For Christian ministries, AI offers new opportunities, such as evangelism chatbots, Bible engagement tools, and decision-making systems for ministry strategies. Yet, ministries must approach AI with caution, ensuring it supplements human efforts rather than replacing them. Ethical use of AI should align with biblical principles, respecting human dignity and fostering justice, love, and human flourishing.
