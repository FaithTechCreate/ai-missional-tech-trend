# Getting Started with AI in Ministry

To begin, ministries should educate staff through FaithTechâ€™s Redemptive AI Course, audit existing workflows, start with small pilots, create tech-ethics teams, and collaborate with other churches or developers. Every initiative should be wrapped in prayer and guided by theological discernment.


## Timeline Expectations

According to [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com), most AI projects in business take 4 years to launch, despite shorter predictions. Organizations should:
- Start with a small pilot project
- Use a "Minimum Viable Product" approach to minimize resource allocation while maximizing learning
- Consider applying AI to a narrow segment of the organization initially
- Look at financial segments as a potential starting point, due to their complexity, key role, and inherent numeric data generation

## Data Requirements

### For Organizations with Substantial Data
- Explore existing "big data" within the organization
- Focus on data that drives organizational goals and decisions
- Leverage metrics already being tracked, as "what gets measured is what gets done"

### For Organizations with Limited Data
Some AI applications require less data and may be more suitable for smaller organizations:
- Modeling personalization
- User engagement systems
- Chatbots

## Technical Requirements

Beyond timeline and data considerations, organizations need:
- AI experts or enthusiasts to spearhead projects
- Appropriate technical capabilities - the "intelligence stack" (see [O'Reilly's analysis](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-state-of-ai-adoption/) of implementation requirements)
