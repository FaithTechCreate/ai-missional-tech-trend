# Infrastructure Needs for AI in Ministry

What infrastructure do ministries need to leverage AI effectively? Here are the key requirements:

## Staff Education

Many ministry organizations are populated with highly relational people, which is their great strength. Some, though, may perceive AI systems as opposed to relationship-building. It's important to acknowledge this concern and the real risks involved.

## Data Requirements

### Volume of Data

AI systems often require large amounts of data to begin with. Whereas third graders will learn to cross the street holding a parent's hand and using "stop, look, and listen," AI systems will require 10,000 or more data-rich videos (and significant energy consumption) to get in the vicinity of achieving a third-grade proficiency.

If an organization doesn't yet have this kind of data, it might consider ways to start gathering data points about individuals and activities within the organization and its networks. Exceptions to these data-hungry needs include:

- Modeling personalization
- User engagement
- Chatbots

### Data Selection

Deciding what data is important and unimportant will require careful attention. Discerning what data to collect and what data to act on, and the difference between the two, requires:

- Prayer
- Discernment
- The leading of the Holy Spirit

## Technical Expertise

### Programming Capabilities

In addition to data, organizations will need programmers capable of creating AI systems that reflect the organization's strategies. Some key approaches include:

1. Partnerships with specialists can be a key strategy in the early stages
2. Organizations with limited amounts of data may want to first consider hiring programmers familiar with algorithms as a way to learn more

Successful AI implementation requires both the right data infrastructure and the technical expertise to leverage it effectively.
