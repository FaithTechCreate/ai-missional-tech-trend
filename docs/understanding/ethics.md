# Biblical and Theological Points of Reference

## Imago Dei

The *imago dei* is a key category Christians can use for evaluating AI systems. Multiple views exist that suggest what the image of God is for humans:

- One view suggests that the imago dei is *what we have*, such as intelligence, consciousness, morality, and so on
- Another view suggests that it is *what we do*, functioning as God's representatives and exercising dominion or stewardship in the world
- Still another view [frames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQRV5LWEtpg) the *imago dei* as grounded in our relational nature, reflecting the Trinity's own nature

Within this relational frame, the *imago dei* is preserved as something unique to humans and not shared by AI systems.

As technology has developed historically, so have theological perspectives on imago dei. New theological frames have developed as new technologies have challenged how humanity thinks about its own identity. In this way, theology and technology have been in dialog, and technological development has continued to help theologians more clearly articulate how humanity images God. Much more theological engagement with the concept of AI is necessary, and Genesis 1-3 can be a guiding light.

## Stewardship

The Bible is certainly no foreigner to classification and decision-making, which are the fundamental skills of AI systems. In Genesis, one of the first tasks God gives to Adam is to name the animals. Today, this act of identifying and naming is still a fundamental role for human beings, and the creation of AI is yet another example of humanity's efforts to fulfill that task. At the same time, as humans delegate this work to AI systems, it will alter how humans fulfill their responsibility in this God-given role.

## Judicial Process 

Moses famously adjudicated the Covenant Law for the people of Israel until he no longer had the capacity to do it all (Exodus 18). Then he distributed the work among "capable, honest men who fear God and hate bribes" (v. 21). Moses institutionalized the decision-making work of judging disputes within the system of Law. Like today, Moses had a flood of information that he had to digest, weigh, and decide onâ€”more than he could handle. Like him, we are drowning in data, more than we can handle, and we look to AI systems to help us to process it, hoping to make sense of it and determine what to do with it. Given these similarities, it's no wonder that today's criminal justice systems are also seeking algorithmic solutions to make sense of it all.

## Civil Systems

Like Moses, the 12 disciples in Acts 6 established a system for food distribution by selecting "seven men who are well respected and are full of the Spirit and wisdom" (Act 6:3). Part of the problem they faced were accusations of systemic discrimination (v. 2). With this emerging need, the disciples developed a programmatic solution that was eventually institutionalized in the 7 men they chose as administrators and decision-makers. Their issues, and solutions, sound surprisingly similar to our own today.

## AI Bias

Today, many are raising legitimate concerns about "[AI bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59bMh59JQDo)." This reality will continue to be a liability in AI systems, just as it was in the food distribution program of the early church. This reality is likely a tension to manage, and not a tension to resolve. Anywhere decision-making is required, bias has the potential to creep in and issues of injustice will arise. 

AI systems will be no different. They will primarily shift where that bias happens, how obvious or obscure it is, and how it might be managed. Pursuing justice will continue to require public awareness, debate, and negotiation over what values are guiding an AI system, and not subject to it.
