# Building AI for Ministry

**AI systems should enhance human relationships and responsibilities, not replace them.** When developing AI systems for ministry use, builders must consider theological and ethical implications, ensuring systems uphold human dignity, align with biblical values, and support human flourishing. 

**AI systems must be designed to embody human values** like fairness, transparency, and accountability. Developers should safeguard privacy, secure data, and establish ethical guardrails—all with the goal that AI systems might support God’s purposes for humanity. Ultimately, Christian builders should prioritize systems that foster love, generosity, and gratitude, aligning AI’s impact with Jesus' call to sacrificial love and the broader goals of Christian discipleship.
