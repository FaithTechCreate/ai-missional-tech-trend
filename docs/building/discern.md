# What AI Systems Might Be Useful to Ministries?

Potential ministry tools include Bible Q&A bots with theological safeguards, discipleship companions tailored to youth and seekers, AI-driven sermon illustrators, chatbots that triage pastoral care, and predictive models for community engagement and mission field targeting. These systems can extend Gospel impact when ethically and wisely applied.


## AI Techniques Taxonomy

Working with AI experts and language models, we identified seven key AI techniques relevant to ministry applications:

1. Machine Learning (ML)
2. Deep Learning
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
4. Computer Vision
5. Expert Systems
6. Robotics and Autonomous Systems
7. Generative AI

## Ministry Areas

We reviewed categories from [Linking Global Voices](https://linkingglobalvoices.com/index.php?id=4) and consolidated them into 14 key ministry areas:

1. Christian Missions and Evangelism
2. Social Justice and Advocacy
3. People Groups and Cultural Contexts
4. Education and Training
5. Healthcare and Disability
6. Economic Development and Poverty Alleviation
7. Youth and Children
8. Arts and Media
9. Ethics and Integrity
10. Technology and Information
11. Leadership and Organizational Roles
12. Urbanization and Cities
13. Sports and Recreation
14. Apologetics and Theological Thought

## Opportunity Matrix

The intersection of these AI techniques with ministry areas creates a comprehensive matrix of potential applications. You can explore the full matrix of possibilities in our [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OFFtU8jD8k0Of-OeAtglxSXBit0nIh1X7fnmQOuxBpU/edit?gid=0).

Some examples of successful implementations include:
- [Compassion International's digital registration system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLSzSbSVqIY)
- [CV Global's JesusBot for evangelism](https://www.facebook.com/jesusbot.co)
- [Wycliffe's AI-assisted Bible translation](https://wycliffe.org.au/how-ai-is-accelerating-bible-translation/)
- [Spf.io's church translation services](https://www.spf.io/)
- [Stanway's scripture-news connection platform](https://www.getstanway.com/)

The matrix serves as a starting point for ministry leaders to identify potential AI applications in their specific context. When considering implementation, organizations should evaluate:

1. Alignment with ministry goals
2. Available resources and expertise
3. Potential impact on beneficiaries
4. Ethical considerations
5. Implementation feasibility

## Next Steps

For ministry leaders interested in exploring AI applications:

1. Review the complete matrix to identify relevant intersections
2. Assess current technological capabilities and resources
3. Consider starting with a pilot project in one specific area
4. Seek partnerships with technical experts or organizations
5. Develop clear success metrics aligned with ministry objectives
