# Implementation Guide for AI Tools in Ministry

This guide outlines how builders can measure the impact and effectiveness of AI tools in ministry contexts. We'll explore various metrics and approaches to ensure AI implementations align with ministry goals and Christian values.

## Measuring Faith Impact

For any redemptive technology, builders and ministries should be able to answer these key questions:

* Does this technology make trust in Jesus more plausible?   
* Does this technology make it easier for people to "live by the Spirit"? 

### Understanding Redemptive Technology

Redemptive technology refers to systems that shape the identity of users to be more like Christ, regardless of what "product" they provide. These technologies make it:
- Easier to trust God, not harder
- More natural to "live by the Spirit"
- More likely for users to grow in their faith

This differs from:

- **Redemptive products**: Those that simply make life better for consumers, regardless of how the business operates
- **Redemptive businesses**: Organizations that make life better for workers, partners, and customers through their conduct, regardless of what they produce

## Character-Oriented Outcomes

At the heart of redemptive technology should be character formation. While "impact metrics" focus on outputs, character development is the core outcome metric for redemptive tech. This longer-term focus on character helps align shorter-term goals with Christian ministry objectives.

Character outcomes are defined by "Christlikeness" - with Jesus embodying the type of character we aim to develop. Both technology and character share a common foundation in habits, aligning with how John Mark Comer describes "practicing the way."

## Forming Key Habits

Technology is fundamentally habit-forming. Users who adopt redemptive technologies should develop two essential habits:

1. **Generosity**
2. **Gratitude**

These habits reflect a worldview that sees all of life as a gift (implying a Giver). While other Christlike qualities may provide additional metrics, these two serve as practical foundations that often lead to other virtues.

This character development is ultimately the work of the Holy Spirit, "giving us the will and the desire to do what pleases God" (Philippians 2:12-13). However, technology can either support or hinder the Spirit's work by cultivating habits that make trust in God more or less plausible.

## Implementation Metrics Summary

To evaluate AI tools in ministry contexts, measure these four key areas:

### Core Questions
1. Does the technology make trust in Jesus more plausible?   
2. Does it make it easier for people to "live by the Spirit"?

### Core Habits
1. Gratitude  
2. Generosity
